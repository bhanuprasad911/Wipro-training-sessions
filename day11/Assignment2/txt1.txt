5. Explain how Pytest supports scalable test automation

Feature,How it handles Scale
Fixtures (conftest.py),"Instead of copying setup code, fixtures are defined once and ""injected"" into any test that needs them."
Modular Design,You can organize tests into hundreds of sub-folders; Pytest’s Discovery Engine finds them automatically without a central registry.
Parallelism (xdist),"As your suite grows from 10 to 1,000 tests, you simply add more CPU cores or worker nodes to keep the execution time low."
Plug-and-Play,"You can add functionality (like database cleanup, browser automation, or mobile testing) by installing a plugin rather than rewriting your core framework logic."
